RLSD is a small, "live" Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/)
distribution with retro applications for the i686 and x86_64 architectures. It
revives old hardware and the way computing used to be in the late 90's.

RLSD's development follows the guidelines in the project manifest described in
MANIFEST.

For more information, see the project homepage (http://rlsd.dimakrasner.com/).

Running
=======

RLSD is available as regular, bootable ISO9660 images, or as a chroot
environment similar to crouton (https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton).

To set up a RLSD chroot environment:
  wget http://goo.gl/fFZwXC
  sudo sh fFZwXC

Daily builds of RLSD are available through its homepage.

Building
========

RLSD is built from source. It is cross-compiled through Ubuntu
(http://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04 x86_64.

The whole process is automated; there's a script (http://goo.gl/8x9id4) that
generates a clean, up-to-date build environment, then cross-compiles the entire
RLSD inside it.

To build a 64-bit RLSD:
  wget http://goo.gl/8x9id4
  sudo sh 8x9id4 ./rlsd-chroot
  sudo ls ./rlsd-chroot/root/rlsd/releases

Alternatively, to build a 32-bit variant, use setarch(1), e.g:
  sudo setarch i486 sh 8x9id4 ./rlsd-chroot

The script should run on Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04 x86_64. It is
highly recommended to read the script first, as it installs debootstrap on the
host.
